# Retail Business Analytics Project

- Business Problem

In this project, I analyze historical retail sales data to understand business performance across regions, product categories, and customer segments. The analysis focuses on identifying key revenue and profit drivers, highlighting inefficiencies such as low-margin products, and translating insights into data-informed recommendations to improve profitability and decision-making.
